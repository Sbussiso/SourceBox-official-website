          <p>A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can understand, process, and generate human language. LLMs are trained on massive amounts of data to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as generating and translating text.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>LLMs are built on machine learning, specifically a type of neural network called a transformer model. They can learn from a large dataset to understand context, nuance, and language patterns. This allows them to perform tasks like writing, translating, and answering questions.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>LLMs are useful for analyzing, summarizing, and creating content across many industries. For example, a case worker might use an LLM to summarize data related to a customer's case, providing a textual overview of key players, case highlights, and suggested next steps.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>SourceBox allows you to customize state-of-the-art LLM's by using your own data and context to accomplish your specific goals.</p>
